## Laravel - Angular Restricted System

This is a template to have a web application with angular which restricts access to the admin panel

Add your computer name to bootstrap/start.php to use de sqlite included in this project

Go to the command line, install composer, then go to the public folder and run npm install followed by bower install

Now you have the /admin panel ready to use, remember to change the seeds so you have your own users and passwords

Also remember to use something else for the database on the production server since sqlite won't do the job
